  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: May 31, 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    This website values your privacy. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store,
    or share any personal information. Here's how we handle data:
  </p>

  <h2>What We Store</h2>
  <p>
    We use your browser’s <strong>localStorage</strong> to remember basic settings
    and improve your experience. For example, we may store:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your theme preference (light/dark)</li>
    <li>Selected leagues, filters, or layout settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Don’t Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit any personal data.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use cookies or analytics.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party tracking tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    Because localStorage is stored in your browser, you have full control. You
    can clear your browser data at any time to remove saved settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have any questions about how this site works, feel free to reach out.

    If we ever begin collecting data or using third-party services, this policy
    will be updated accordingly.
