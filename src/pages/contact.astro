    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: May 31, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      This website values your privacy. We aim to minimize data collection and
      provide transparency about what is stored and how it's used.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Store</h2>
    <p>
      We use your browser's <strong>localStorage</strong> to remember basic settings
      and improve your experience. For example, we may store:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your theme preference (light/dark)</li>
      <li>Selected leagues, filters, or layout settings</li>
      <li>
        Anonymous site usage data (e.g., page views, device type) via Google
        Analytics
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit personal data without your
        knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use cookies for advertising or track you across
        other websites.
      </li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share any usage data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to understand how visitors interact
      with the site, such as which pages are most visited, how long users stay, and
      what devices are used. This information is anonymized and helps us improve
      the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google Analytics may set cookies or collect usage information in
      accordance with its own privacy policies. You can learn more about how
      Google uses data <a
        href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Control</h2>
    <p>
      Because localStorage is stored in your browser, you have full control. You
      can clear your browser data at any time to remove saved settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use browser extensions or settings to opt out of Google
      Analytics tracking if you prefer not to share anonymous usage data.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any questions about how this site works or handles your data,
      feel free to reach out.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      If we ever begin collecting identifiable data or using additional
      third-party services, this policy will be updated accordingly.
